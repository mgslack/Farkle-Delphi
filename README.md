# Farkle-Delphi
Delphi version of Farkle

Original version of Farkle I created with Delphi (3.0) back in 2009.  Added additional unit and 'dice'
components to the repository so the application can be compiled.  Note: uses TurboPower components from
the Orpheus and SysTools packages.  Bought both years ago, but now available as freeware at the following
locations for those that do not have them:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tporpheus/

https://github.com/TurboPack/Orpheus

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpsystools/

https://github.com/TurboPack/SysTools

The TurboPower packages are well worth the effort to download and install.  Have saved me a lot of time
and effort, particularly the Orpheus packages.

Have an old copy of Delphi 3 that I use off and on and maintain this program using that copy.  May
be possible to compile using Delphi 10.x (Embarcadero RadStudio), but other than installing Orpheus,
SysTools and the Dice component within the environment, have not tried to compile in the later version.
